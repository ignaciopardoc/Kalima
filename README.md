# Kalima
Webpage for Kalima Estudio

This is my first project :)

It is a personal webpage for a Graphic Desing Studio located in MÃ¡laga, Spain. It includes a task manager for the projects that this studio have.

Uses SQL for the database and the enviroment is NODE. Also for the front uses Bootstap which is included.

First you need to install a MySQL server as a database (I use locally MySQL workbench) and run the sql scripts located on the "SQL Files" folder. It will create the structure of the DB.

Install Node from the official webpage and on the console locate on the main folder and execute "npm install" to download all the necesary modules.

Then just execute "npm start" and it will start a server on "localhost:3000" and enjoy ;)
